Use WebDriver Manager (https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) instead of chromedriver.exe found from Windows %PATH% variable.
 * When running the automation project, no extra drivers or dependencies should be needed to add manually.

Replace FirefoxDriver with ChromeDriver.

Try to replace MainTest.waitForLoading with a method similar to waitForElementNotPresent from Selenium IDE.
Currently it seems it puts the WebDriver on hold for 500ms, but the thread running Java immediately continues executing the following assertEquals case.

Clean up main.java.Main method.

Plan ahead - design and document what you want to test before writing the tests.
